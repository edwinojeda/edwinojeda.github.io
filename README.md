## What Leaders Say

Todd DeLaughter CEO, Board Chairman, Board Advisor

Watching Super Bowl LV this past weekend spurred me to write this review for Edwin Ojeda. Edwin is the rare sales leader who doesn't just close deals, he builds strategy and executes plans for bigger and longer term relationships that can transform business outcomes for the companies who employ him.

Edwin proposed sponsoring a Super Bowl LI client event in Houston with 15+ C-suite executives. No brainer for me because he had already proven his ability to build and capitalize on relationships with our biggest customers. 

That event exceeded even my expectations with $30M+ in new revenue stemming directly from the relationships deepened during that event. I watched Edwin demonstrate what separates elite CROs from good ones. Customers on the field after the game tossing footballs around were little kids again. We made lifetime memories.

Beyond this Super Bowl event, what makes Edwin truly exceptional is his ability to build and inspire teams through genuine personal relationships. He demands excellence but with a relationship in place that allows the people he challenges to elevate their game. He builds winners.

Edwin understands that enterprise sales at scale requires more than pipeline management. It demands the ability to think like a CEO, build trusted advisor relationships with C-suite buyers, and create experiences that accelerate complex sale cycles. He delivered on all three.

Edwin is a force multiplier who will elevate your entire go-to-market strategy.
